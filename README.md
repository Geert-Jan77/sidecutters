# Side Cutters
CAD Software

## Aim
This software should be free. The aim of this project is to create a multi platform app while starting from a windows platform.
It should create electrical drawings automatically and export them as bookmarked printable datafile (pdf).

## How?
The software is licensed GPL/LGPL version 2. The Compiler is gcc, not Microsoft Visual Studio and the project is written in C, not in C#. 
Windows operating system functionality is never used, and the application is not on the Windows API but the GTK 3 API. This project will have no build system other than a simple *batch* or *bash* file. Its only dependency will be GTK 3. 

## A table
The user of the program will select components and edit the connections between them. This is done in a **table** 
He will press the *Generate* button with the *Side Cutter* icon and all the drawing's pages are generated automatically.

## I want this software!
Then maybe you should help program it. Start by compiling the source on your pc. Read the *doc* folder on how to compile.
