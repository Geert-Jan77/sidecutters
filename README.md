# Side Cutters
CAD Software

## Aim
This software should be free. The aim of this project is to create a multi platform app while starting from a windows platform.
It should create electrical drawings automatically and export them as bookmarked printable datafile (pdf).

## How?
The software is licensed GPL/LGPL version 2. The Compiler is gcc, not Microsoft Visual Studio and the project is written in C, not in C#. 
If Windows operating system functionality is used, we import the operating system's dynamical linked library. Windows forms will not be used, we create our own forms instead. This poject will have no dependencies.

## A table
The user of the program will select components and edit the connections between them. This is done in a [table]. 
He will press the *Generate* button with the *Side Cutter* icon and all the drawing's pages are generated automatically.
