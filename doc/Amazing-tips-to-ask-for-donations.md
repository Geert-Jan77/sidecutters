When asking for donations, you must consider the amazing six tips:

 - Our opensource community is setting the standard on software, we are the best programmers, we are elite and giving is better than taking
 - CAD/ CAM Software that is created to compete for profit is of nu use at all. It targets people that don't work with it, lacks vision and quality and can't be adapted
 - Existing CAD software for wiring diagrams is financially out of reach for middle large businesses. These programs are expensive and functionally poor.
 - The choice of the Side Cutter icon is not a coincidence, a wiring diagram should include the length of all wires because someone in your organisation has to cut them
 - CAD/ CAM software is a tool to create systems. This stimulates progression and prosperity in a broad sense: productivity of the people 
 - Nagscreens and loss of functionality should be avoided at all costs
