When asking for donations, you must consider the following:

 - CAD/ CAM Software that is created to compete for profit is of nu use at all. It targets people that don't work with it, lacks vision and quality.
 - The choice of the Side Cutter icon is not a coincidence. An electrical drawing should include the length of all wires because someone in your organisation has to cut them. 
 - Our opensource community is setting the standard on software, we are elite
 - CAD/ CAM software is a tool to create systems. This stimulates progression and prosperity in a broad sense; productivity of the people and social equality
 - Nagscreens, loss of functionality
