When asking for donations, you must consider the following:

 - Our opensource community is setting the standard on software, we are the best programmers, we are elite and giving is better than taking
 - There is no official standard for software, there is no CE declaration of conformity and no notified body to test it according to the standard
 - CAD/ CAM Software that is created to compete for profit is of nu use at all. It targets people that don't work with it, lacks vision and quality and can't be adapted
 - The choice of the Side Cutter icon is not a coincidence, a wiring diagram should include the length of all wires because someone in your organisation has to cut them
 - CAD/ CAM software is a tool to create systems. This stimulates progression and prosperity in a broad sense; productivity of the people and social equality
 - Nagscreens and loss of functionality should be avoided at all costs
