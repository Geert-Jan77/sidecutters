## Other sizes

### A4 paper format

The A0 size is defined as follows:
The paper has an area of one square meter. The aspect ratio is the square root of two.
The exact A0_width = 2^(1/4) m and the exact A0_height = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/4) / 2 m
The A1 size is obtained by halving the longest side of an A0, and after halving the paper four times, the A4 size is obtained.

The exact A4_width = 2^(1/4) / 4 m and the exact A4_height = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/4) / 8 m 
This evaluates to 297.3 mm x 210.2 mm

### Letter

The letter size is 11 x 8.5 inches. It is exactly 279.4 mm x  215.9 mm
